# backup-ec2-volumes
Script to snapshot all volumes associated with ec2 instances

This scripts intention is to be ran daily via lambda.

TODO:
* Wait for AWS Lambda to support python 3.*
* Change script to be executable via lambda (currently works on laptop)
* Add iam/policy info
* create code to deploy it (terraform?)
